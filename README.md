Cricket World Cup 2023 Ontology Mapping and Data Analysis
Project Overview
This project involves the creation of an ontology to map the delivery statistics of the Cricket World Cup 2023. The process includes using RDFLib in Python to leverage CSV data and ontology definitions, generating Turtle (.ttl) files, and employing SPARQL queries to extract meaningful statistics from the World Cup delivery data.
Project Components
1.	Ontology Creation: An ontology has been designed to represent the domain-specific information related to delivery statistics in the Cricket World Cup 2023. The ontology provides a structured and standardized way of organizing and understanding the data.
2.	RDFLib Integration: The RDFLib library in Python has been utilized to convert CSV data into RDF triples based on the defined ontology. This step ensures that the data is represented in a format compatible with the semantic web.
3.	Turtle (.ttl) Files Generation: RDFLib is used to serialize the RDF triples into Turtle (.ttl) files. These files capture the relationships and attributes defined in the ontology, making the data easily readable and shareable.
4.	SPARQL Queries: SPARQL queries have been implemented to extract meaningful statistics and insights from the Cricket World Cup 2023 delivery data. These queries can be customized to answer specific questions about the matches, players, or any other relevant aspects of the tournament.
